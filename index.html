    <p>
      I'm a graphic designer with a focus on branding, digital content, and layout design. 
      I love creating visuals that are not just eye-catching, but thoughtful and intentional. 
      Whether it’s a bold poster, a clean mobile layout, or a full brand identity, I design with purpose and personality.
